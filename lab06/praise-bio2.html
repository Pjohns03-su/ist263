    <strong> Im from New York City,</strong> and I am a sociology major. I am interested in sociology because I like to know the way systems in place affect people in society. Outside of school, I make music, and I like to dance. I live with my mother and older sister, and I am the youngest sibling. I decided to take web design because I’m interested in it,and I would like to leave college with a hard skill.
